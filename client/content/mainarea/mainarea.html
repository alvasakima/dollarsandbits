    <h1>Welcome to Dollars And Bits!</h1>
    <p>If you're a US citizen, every day for your entire life you have been bombarded with price signals denominated in dollars.
      This is the reason if you happen to spot a gallon of milk selling for 10 dollars you know instantly
      its overpriced. This site is intended to train your brain to think about prices in bitcoin. By the time
      we're done a number like 546k bits will strike you as a smoking deal for a bicycle.</p>
      <p>Lets get to it!</p>
      <p>First things first..</p>
      <p>Dollars are to cents as Bitcoins are to Satoshis</p>
      <p>When looking at any bitcoin price, the amount after the decimal point is the amount of Satoshis. The only difference
      is there are 8 decimal places instead of the 2 you're used to. This doesn't make it any harder to read, once you train
    yourself to see the places. Its like going back to 3rd grade in a way.</p>
      <p>Calculating bits is not difficult. Its a matter of moving the decimal point to make a large number more readable</p>
